For the Github:
You can Copy cert path from configuration git;

Please, follow the Versions:

NPM version: v5.6.0
Node version: v8.9.4

Task Running is organized by Webpack.
(P.S. 2 Days were spent, because my PC was not compatible with lots of things, and it has been 2 years I did not deal with babel/webpack version handling, there are core errors in Webpack new versions)

ENV:
Dev: npm run dev
Prod: npm run dev
Start: npm start/npm run start

Once the setup is done, you can check the following functionalities:

1.  Search users by random username: eg "Kira"
2.  On down left side, there is a pagination, it should bring "Page 2", click it,
3.  Now you are in 2nd page, you will have both "Prev(page1)" and "Next(page3)", check if they work fine
    About pagination:
    Pagination works with 14 item on each page, cause it was more beautiful.
    Did not have time to make the pagination work with making a request to the server for further items, but prepared that part with "URIs", where you can see that I get link from headers.
    This means, now for testing, the static part of it is done for it.
4.  You can now click on one of the users: It will bring User Avatar and the repositories.
5.  Click on any repo, it will throw you to real repository page
6.  Or just Refresh the page, but the user info will be brought again to you (avatar and repos) eg. http://localhost:8081/#VersionBeathon
    P.S. Only user info, not whole users' list, just did not have time for that.
7.  I took care, such that on any new search everything will be cleared up, you can check it, for sure.
8.  I worked on styling as much as I could get into time.
9.  By the way, Logo was made by me, by AdobeXd, just a simple kind gesture.
10. Was not familiar with Github API, it was interesting.


Decided to write the readme file in the morning, with fresh head, and share the repo then with you.

I would dive in more into the best ways to do everything, but not taken into account the 2 days spent on server configuration, making webpack/babel work, I had overall 11 hours to work on JS+html/css.
Let me know what you think. Btw, I am going to continue working on this Repo and finish this app on my side.
